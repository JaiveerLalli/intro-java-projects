Music Playlist Manager
Overview

Music Playlist Manager is a console-based Java application that allows users to create and manage a custom music playlist. Users can add songs, play songs, view their playlist, and manage a listening history.

This project demonstrates the use of queues, stacks, loops, conditionals, and exception handling in Java.

Features:

    - Add songs to a playlist
    - Play songs in first-in-first-out order
    - View the current playlist without changing order
    - Track listening history
    - Print song history (most recent first)
    - Delete songs from recent or earliest history
    - Clear listening history
    - Menu-driven user interface


Data Structures Used:

  Queue (LinkedList)
    - Used to store and manage the playlist of songs.

  Stack (Stack)
    - Used to store the history of played songs, with the most recent song on top.

  Program Flow
    - User selects an option from the menu.

  Songs are added to a queue.
    - Playing a song removes it from the queue and adds it to the history stack.

The playlist can be viewed without modifying order.
The history can be printed, cleared, or partially deleted.
The program continues until the user chooses to quit.

Menu Options

(A) Add song
(P) Play song
(H) Print history
(V) View playlist
(C) Clear history
(D) Delete from history
(Q) Quit

Error Handling

IllegalStateException is thrown when:
    Playing a song with an empty playlist

    Viewing playlist or history when empty

IllegalArgumentException is thrown when:
    Attempting to delete more songs than exist in history

Technologies Used
